The stages of supercomputer application may be summarized in the following 
table:

Decade | Uses and computer involved
-------|---------------------------
1970s | Weather forecasting, aerodynamic research (Cray-1).
1980s | Probabilistic analysis, radiation shielding modeling (CDC Cyber).
1990s | Brute force code breaking (EFF DES cracker).
2000s | 3D nuclear test simulations as a substitute for legal conduct Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (ASCI Q).
2010s | Molecular Dynamics Simulation (Tianhe-1A)


The IBM Blue Gene/P computer has been used to simulate a number of artificial 
neurons equivalent to approximately one percent of a human cerebral cortex, 
containing 1.6 billion neurons with approximately 9 trillion connections. The 
same research group also succeeded in using a supercomputer to simulate a 
number of artificial neurons equivalent to the entirety of a rat's brain.

Modern-day weather forecasting also relies on supercomputers. The [National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](http://www.noaa.gov) uses supercomputers to crunch hundreds 
of millions of observations to help make weather forecasts more accurate.

In 2011, the challenges and difficulties in pushing the envelope in 
supercomputing were underscored by IBM's abandonment of the Blue Waters 
petascale project.
