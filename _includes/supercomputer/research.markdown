Given the current speed of progress, industry experts estimate that 
supercomputers will reach 1 exaflops (10<sup>18</sup>, one quintillion FLOPS) 
by 2018. China has stated plans to have a 1 exaflop supercomputer online by 
2018. Using the Intel MIC multi-core processor architecture, which is Intel's 
response to GPU systems, SGI plans to achieve a 500-fold increase in 
performance by 2018, in order to achieve one exaflop. Samples of MIC chips with 
32 cores, which combine vector processing units with standard CPU, have become 
available. The Indian government has also stated ambitions for an exaflop-range 
supercomputer, which they hope to complete by 2017.

Erik P. DeBenedictis of [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov) theorizes that a zettaflop 
(10<sup>21</sup>, one sextillion FLOPS) computer is required to accomplish full 
weather modeling, which could cover a two-week time span accurately. Such 
systems might be built around 2030.
